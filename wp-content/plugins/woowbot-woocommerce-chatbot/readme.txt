<strong>Artificial Intelligence and NLP </strong>

WoowBot is Intelligent - Powered by AI. Integrate with <strong>OpenAI <strong>(ChatGPT)</strong> or <strong>Google’s DialogFlow</strong>. It is capable of Small Talk, can carry on a conversation flow and fulfill any reasonable request. 


<strong>OpenAI (ChatGPT) for WoowBot Pro</strong>

As soon as you add the OpenAI API key to the ChatBot OpenAI settings, it can answer all types of generic questions. Questions like “what is the capital city of Japan” or “What is a blackhole?”
You can format your custom Dataset as a .jsonl file. Then upload and train (Fine tune) your chosen OpenAI model. Once trained OpenAI will use your custom dataset to answer natural language questions.

 
You can train the OpenAI API with your WordPress Pages, Posts and Custom Post type content! After generating the dataset with your website data you can download it to make further adjustments or troubleshooting or send the dataset directly to OpenAI for fine tuning.

 
Create royalty free AI generated images just by writing what kind of images you want. Select the image you like and download it directly to your WordPress media library. You can select from a wide variety of options to fine tune your image style, lighting, color, size etc.

 
Use OpenAI to generate SEO friendlt articles and contents for your Blogs and any other purposes. Options to fine tune your articles (How many headings?, Heading Tag, Writing Style, Writing Tone, Image Size, Language, Add Image, Add Tagline, Add Introduction, Add Conclusion, Add Faq, Anchor Text, Target URL, Add Call-to-Action, Call-to-Action Position, Add Keywords, Keywords to Avoid, Make Keywords Bold etc.)


<strong>Onsite Retargeting, Exit Intent</strong>

Recover up to 25% of Abandoning Visitors with Onsite Retargeting. WoowBot detects exiting Visitors and displays a targeted offer to your visitor determined by you. Up to 25% of retargeted visitors will respond to your message and turn into customers. Targeted offers can be a coupon code, free ebook etc.
In-Chat Support and Contact

The Onsite Retargeting helps your Conversion rate optimization by showing special offers and coupons on Exit Intent, time interval or page scroll-down inside the ChatBot window. Track Customer Conversions with statistics to find out if shoppers are abandoning carts without completing orders. Get more sales!

<strong>Reduce Shopping Cart Abandonment</strong>
In addition to exit intent and remarketing offers, WoowBot can remind users to complete the checkout process when shoppers have products in the cart but they are not completing the order for some reason. Many shoppers add products to the cart but leave the site from other pages, after continuing to browse, before or after they reached the cart page. 

If a user leaves the site and later comes back – WoowBot will remind the shopper with a custom message to complete the order!

All of these will translate into a much higher rate of customer conversion by reducing the potentials for Abandoned Cart.

<strong>In-Chat Support and Contact</strong>

WoowBot pro provides support directly from the Chat window. You can add commonly asked questions (FAQ) and answers in the backend that WoowBot will display when user goes to support area. If the shopper does not find answers to his question in the FAQ, he can opt to send a email to site admin or leave feedback!

<strong>Schedule the ChatBot to Work with other Live Chat Service</strong>

You can schedule WoowBot Pro to run only when you are not available for Live chat with other services – outside of your normal office hours. The Onsite Retargeting helps your Conversion rate optimization by showing your special offers and coupons on Exit Intent, time interval or page scroll down inside the chatbot window. Get rid of those other Exit Intent popups with a chatbot that talks directly with the shopper. Reduce Abandoned Cart by showing timely messages with the Chat Bot!
